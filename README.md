# Design-a-circuit-to-control-the-eyes-of-the-robot-and-a-power-supply
In this project, I create a circuit to control the robot's eye including a power supply system.
Bring a battery, a breadboard, two capacitors, two LEDs, four resistors, a timer, an oscilloscope, a polarized capacitor, a 5V regulator (LM7805), and a pMOS transistor (MOSFET). 
Begin by connecting the negative part of the battery to the negative part of the breadboard and the positive part to the positive part. 
Connect the resistors to the cathode of the LEDs, then to the negative part of the breadboard.
Connect the negative part of the Oscilloscope to the breadboard's negative and the positive to the Timer in the out port, then connect the Timer to the pMOS Transistor in the Gate part. So after this connect the Polarized Capacitor negative part with the negative in the breadboard, as well as the positive part. 
Timer connects the ground to the negative part, then the trigger to the threshold, then the power and reset to the positive and Terminal1 in the resistor, and the discharge to Terminal2 in the resistor.Following this plug the Polarized Capacitor negative part with the negative in the breadboard, also the positive part. The 5V Regulator is plugged in with positive and out with Terminal 2 in the capacitor and Drain in the pMOS. Finally, connect the capacitors to the breadboard's negative part.
